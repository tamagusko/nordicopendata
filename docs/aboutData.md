The central datasets at the hackathon are road camera datasets from across the five Nordic countries. Road camera data consists of a photo stream or data feed from web cameras located alongside roads in the Nordic countries. 

Several other datasets will be curated to be used by you alongside the road camera datasets. 

- Traffic events and roadworks dataset (traffic incidents, road conditions, traffic disorders)
- Weather datasets (wind, downpour, temperature, water levels etc)
- Air quality datasets (pollution in an area, air quality measurements, weather, emissions)
