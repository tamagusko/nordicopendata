# notes about data

- For this challenge, images from 150 cameras were made available in 5 Nordic countries, namely, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden.
- Camera metadata was made available under the name 30Cameras_Metadata_COUNTRY (path: /data/raw/roadcamerametada/).
- The images are from cameras with timestamps between 5-10s to 10min in two parts, one with 24h (15-16th march 2022) and another with ~22h (16-17th march 2022).
- In the raw data folder the ones named COUNTRYroadcamera correspond to the photos from the 15th-16th, and the ones with the COUNTRYroadcamera2 are from the 16th-17th.
- The alarm (fake) images were artificially developed by our team to simulate unusual events to be detected.
